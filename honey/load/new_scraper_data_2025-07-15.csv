 After three generations of beekeeping, packing, and producing, rice's lucky clover honey is still a small family business. From the beginning, all the honey produced was run through cheesecloth, instead of a pressure filter, to help retain the natural pollen and enzymes. Our priority is still to produce an excellent quality honey. Rice’s honey is still run through cheesecloth and never overheated. Nothing is added. Its 100% pure honey, continuing the original goal of retaining a natural product and leaving in the pollen and enzymes.
