    ****WTI Crude Oil Price Forecast****
    -  Collected 14 datasets via the Federal Reserve's API corresponding to supply, demand, and economic categories to train
    machine learning modelsâ€™ to forecast daily prices of crude oil.
    - Performed feature engineering by aggregating oil production data to increase model
    accuracy by 5%.
    - Discovered the US Dollar(56%) and world oil consumption(28%) were the most important
    features for the XGBRegressor model.

    ****Inflation Forecasting****
    - Collected 7 economic datasets via an API in monthly frequency from 1975-2024 to forecast inflation using machine learning.
    - Trained 3 different models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR) and used RMSE to
    determine that the Support Vector Regression(SVR) model had the most accurate forecast.
    - Cleaned and analyzed the datasets which revealed all data was non-normally distributed
    with tail occurrences happening relatively frequently.
    - Discovered the model was more accurate when filling missing values in the dataset with
    their respective averages due to having more data for training.
